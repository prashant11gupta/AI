Problem Statement
-------------------

1. (25 points) Search A*
1.1. (15 points) Run A* search algorithm on the Romanian Map route-finding problem to find
the shortest path between Oradea and Bucharest. Use as the heuristic function straight distance.
What route was discovered? How many nodes were expanded? What is the cost of this solution?
Please, use https://github.com/aima-java/aima-java/. The goal is to see high-quality implementation
of the algorithm and good architecture. You might need install Eclipse for this.
1.2. (10 points) Same problem as in 1.1 with a new evaluation function f’=(1-w)g + wh, where
w=0.25 and w=075.
1.3. (10 extra points) Implement a new under-estimating heuristic function h’ (of your choice)
and use it for problem 1.1.
